                        <p>
                            The Workspace project is a very ambitious project that has a broad vision. Hence, the first
                            step I took was to conduct a few rounds of stakeholder interviews to understand the
                            short-term and long-term goals and the business considerations behind the decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-italic">"Workspace is going to be the backbone of our company. Users can manage
                            all kinds of assets on it, including their measurement data, device information, and
                            employee accounts. The first step should be making what we already have accessible to our
                            users."</p>
                        <p style="text-align:right;">-- CPO</p>

                        <h5>Reginal Sales, Product Managers & Tech Lead</h5>
                        <p>
                            After getting the project's vision and the scope of the first release, I talked to internal
                            users, i.e., regional sales, sensors' product managers, and tech lead to understand the
                            potential users, needs of the users, and technical constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>What's more important is to spread the idea of this new project so that they would inform me
                            when there's an idea/news that might be related.</p>

                        <h5>Let's focus on inspection data management!</h5>
                        <p>From the internal team discussion, I learned that many of our users are either individual
                            inspectors or small inspection companies. Managing device or employee accounts wouldn't be
                            crucial to them. However, with more and more inspection measurements, there was an
                            increasing need to organize the measurement data. Additionally, we didn't have the
                            infrastructure for managing device and employee accounts information. Hence, we decided to
                            focus on inspection data management in the first release. </p>

                        <p>
                            After gathering the initial requirements, I noticed a few knowledge gaps in my team. We
                            decided to talk to the users in person to narrow the gap. We derived the questions from the
                            3 main questions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What does the data process flow of our user look like?</li>
                            <li>What are the data that are more important to our users?</li>
                            <li>How do our users feel about the data viewers in our existing products?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>From the discussion with the internal team, we learned there are, in general, 2 types of
                            users: on-site workers and civil engineers.

                            <p>During the recruitment, we tried to have a good mix of both types. And we found 2 on-site

                            same group of user with similar functionalities. But we did find a few indirect competitors
                            who have similar philosophy as the Workspace. And they are iCloud, Google Suite, Office 365,
                            Adobe Creative Cloud, Autodesk A360.

                            For usability testing, I conducted remote, moderated Think Aloud testing over Zoom. I tested
                            around the key tasks I identified earlier in the process, asking the user to find a
                            particular measurement and its related information, asking the user to share and export the
                            measurement, asking the user to find probes and their contract information.

                            Each task was followed by a SEQ rating. To understand the overall feeling, at the end of the
                            test, I added a SUS survey and had a short discussion with the tester.

                        <p>Taking what I learned from the usability testing and feedback from design review meetings, I
                            began to make revisions to my design. Here are two examples in this section.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-8 m-4rem-t">
                        <h5>1. Remove the App tiles and use side navbar for navigating between apps.</h5>
                        <p>In the usability testing, we noticed all the testers tried to find the measurement file from
                            Recent Files instead of clicking the app tiles when we asked them to open a measurement
                            file. Also, when we asked about the App tiles, they weren't sure where it would lead them
                            to. Thus, in the new design, I tried to reduce the cognitive load by reusing the side navbar
                            from the data viewer screen. Also, the new position gives the app navigation more prominence
                            as when people browsing a site, they usually start from the top right.</p>

                        <h5>2. Group all actions together and put them at top left.</h5>
                        <p>We also noticed the users overlooked the action buttons on the top right corner in the
                            usability testing. My hypothesis was: the refresh button in teal grabbed the most attention
                            from users - most people scan a webpage from the top left, plus the color is very
                            eye-catching. Hence I decided to put the buttons together so that when users see the refresh
                            button, they would also see the buttons in grey. </p>

                            with designs that give a consistent look and feel as the Workspace is crucial. Hence a big

                            more functionalities and supporting the integration of other products. A quote from our
                            product manager - "Workspace helps a lot while we are selling our products. The
                            accessibility of data and collaboration functionality have become a unique selling point for
                            our products."
