                                Screening Eagle, formerly called Proceq, was specialized in NDT portable sensor
                                business. Recently, the company has slowly transitioned its business into the SaaS
                                model. And there are tons of user-generated data stored on its cloud. The company
                                identified an opportunity to build a cloud-based web platform that makes these data more
                                accessible to the users and links all the products together to create a powerful
                                ecosystem.

                        <h5>Stakeholder Interviews</h5>
                        <p>
                            The Workspace project is a very ambitious project that has a broad vision. Hence, the first
                            step I took was to conduct a few rounds of stakeholder interviews to understand the
                            short-term and long-term goals and the business considerations behind the decisions.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Internal user & product experts</h5>
                        <p>
                            The stakeholder interviews helped me understand that the Workspace is going to be a platform
                            that allows the individual product teams to provide services to their users. And as the
                            first step, we should make users' data available and accessible on Workspace. So it's
                            crucial to understand the different needs of different products and their users.
                            Interviewing the internal employees, e.g., the regional sales and the sensors' product
                            managers, helped me understand the customer segments and the products.

                        <p>
                            After gathering the initial requirements, I noticed a few knowledge gaps in my team. We
                            decided to talk to the users in person to narrow the gap. We derived the questions from the
                            3 main questions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What does the data process flow of our user look like?</li>
                            <li>What are the data that are more important to our users?</li>
                            <li>How do our users feel about the data viewers in our existing products?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>On-site Workers & Engineers</h5>
                        <p>From the discussion with the internal employees, we learned there are, in general, 2 types of
                            users: on-site workers and civil engineers.

                            <p>During the recruitment, we tried to have a good mix of both types. And we found 2 on-site

                            same group of user with similar functionalities. But we did find a few indirect competitors
                            who have similar philosophy as the Workspace. And they are iCloud, Google Suite, Office 365,
                            Adobe Creative Cloud, Autodesk A360.

                            Before move to the implementation, I decided to create an interactive prototype with Figma,
                            conduct usability testings with a few users to spot potential usability issues. For
                            usability testing, I conducted remote, moderated Think Aloud testing over Zoom. I tested
                            around the key tasks I identified earlier in the process, asking the user to find a
                            particular measurement and its related information, asking the user to share and export the
                            measurement, asking the user to find probes and their contract information.

                            Each task was followed by a SEQ rating. To understand the overall feeling, at the end of the
                            test, I added a SUS survey and had a short discussion with the tester.

                            The Workspace was then luanched in mid of 2021. And we are continuing improving it by adding
                            more functionalities and supporting the integration of other products. A quote from our
                            product manager - "Workspace helps a lot while we are selling our products. The
                            accessibility of data and collaboration functionality have become a unique selling point for
                            our products."
