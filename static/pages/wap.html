                                <div>HUE Mail is an email system of Works Applications enterprise suits. It has 3 main digital channels: the admin portal, desktop website, and mobile app. In this project, I worked with the product owner of HUE Mail and the sales team to define the problems related to security issues, discover potential solutions, and deliver the interactive designs by following the company design system.

                                Due to the limited time and resources, I couldn't interview any real customers. As the target customers of the HUE Mail system were Japanese companies, and the majority of them are in banking and government fields.

                                I did my research by interviewing people who worked in the same fields in my circle. And I summarized my findings in user scenarios and sent them to the product owner and sales in the Japan office to review. It helped me to align my understanding and the direction of the project with the business side.

                            <p>Being a financial company with strict restrictions about sending attachments outside the organization, their administrator wants an approval flow for all users trying to send an attachment.

                            <p>The employee of a financial company wants to send mail outside the company that contains an attachment. He needs to submit an approval request to his supervisor.</p>
                            <h6>Send Reminder</h6>
                            <p>The employee who already submitted an approval request to his supervisor wants to remind his supervisor to approve. </p>

                            <h5>Admin</h5>
                            <p>
                                I split the rule creation process into 4 steps. The progress bar encourages completion and reduces anxiety by clearly communicating how far they are from finishing. The Back and Next button at the footer of the modal helps the rule creator to navigate between steps. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The input fields may change depending on the input/selection. E.g., the checklists for the mail sender shows when the admin set the policy to be 'Alert only'. However, it won't show if the admin selects 'forbid sending'.

                            <p>
                                The send request feature was integrated into the sending mail journey. If the mail doesn't violate any rules, the flow was the same as sending an email. Otherwise, it introduced an additional step to asks the mail sender to double-check the mail content and send a request for approval if needed.                            </p>
                            <h6>Send Reminder</h6>
                            <p>
                                After discussing with the product owner,  we decided not to include this feature in HUE Mail. To make the communication more efficient, we introduced this feature in the HUE Talk system, which is a system dedicates to chat services.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Change Approver</h6>
                            <p>
                                We also simplified this feature due to technical constraints. Instead of changing approvers, the users have to cancel the request and send another new request with the new approver.

                                The HUE Mail Security Feature was released in September 2017.  We conducted usability testing on 5 existing users in Japan remotely. From the usability, the testing result shows that users can complete most of the tasks without guidance. :) 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, they shared the concern of highlighting the rules violated by the email may allow the mail senders to bypass the rules and cause security issues. And this is definitely a problem we should explore more in the future.
